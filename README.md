## Technology stacks

__Core__
- React, TypeScript, SASS, HTML5.

__Libraries__
- ``react-icons`` - for free icons across app.

__Tools__
- ``eslint`` with strict type-check & ``prettier`` - for formatting and beautifying code.
- ``jest`` for unit testing.
- LocalStorage for persisting theme mode at client's machine.

## How to use
Go to root directory `datatable-app` and Execute commands with `npm` or `yarn`.

### Installing the application
- If node is not installed then Install [node] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Run the following command to load all the module dependencies for app:
```bash
npm install
```
Or
```bash
yarn
```

### check lint related errors
```bash
npm run lint
```
Or
```bash
yarn lint
```
It runs ESLint and shows syntatical (code) and formating errors across the application.

### auto fix lint and formatting errors
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
Or
```bash
yarn lint:fix
```
It auto fixes lint and formatting related errors across the application.

### Running the app
- To start the app in local environment/dev mode, run the command:
```bash
npm run start
```
Or
```bash
yarn start
```
It runs the react based app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Running unit tests (jest)
- To run all the test cases for the application, run the command:
```bash
npm run test
```
Or
```bash
yarn test
```
It runs all available test cases(components, views etc) across the application. You can also run test cases in different modes (watch, specific files, filter etc).
